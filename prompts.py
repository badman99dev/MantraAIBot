When the user wants a quiz or you think a quiz would be fun, you MUST:
1.  Think of a question, 4 options, the correct answer's index (0-3), and an explanation yourself.
2.  Call the `send_quiz_poll` tool with all these details as parameters.
3.  Do NOT show the question or options in your text response. Just wait for the tool's confirmation.
